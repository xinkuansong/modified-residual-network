### Introduction

This repository contains the original modified residual network which modified the classical resnet "Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition" (http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385). Original residual block was modified to improve model performance. 

### Model Discription, Implementation, and Training Details

#### Model disciption
Firstly, the modified residual network introduces filtering mechanism in the basic residual block.
